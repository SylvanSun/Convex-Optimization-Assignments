# Course-Assignments-AISJTU
Part of the assignments I did studying at SJTU

## Motivations
Starting from Spring 2022, I decided to upload some of my codes and latex files onto github enlightened by one of my friends. 

## FYI
For anyone who is browsing this page for reference about his or her assignment, I sincerely hope that some of my ideas or codes will be helpful for you. But remember to list this site as source for the courses with honor codes. :D

I will maintain these files up-to-date but I cannot guarantee their correctness. For some of the course assignments that is beyong my ability, I will only record my trials and possibly there will not be a satisfying answer.
