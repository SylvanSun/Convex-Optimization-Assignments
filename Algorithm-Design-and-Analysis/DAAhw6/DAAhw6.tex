\section*{Problem 1}
\textbf{Proof of NP}:\\
For any possible solution denoted by $G'=(V',E')$,
we show that we can check if $G'$ is a clique with size exactly $n/2$ in ploynomial time.\\
This solution should provide us with a injective mapping $f$ from $V'$ to $V$
where for any $v\in V'$, $f(v)\in V$.\\
Thus we only need to check whether $|V'|=n/2, |E'|=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ and 
check whether $\forall e=(u,v)\in E',(f(u),f(v))\in E$.
Clearly this verification process can be done in ploynomial time.\\
\textbf{Proof of NP-Completeness}:\\
We prove by showing that the k-clique problem is reducible to our probelm here.\\
For any k-clique problem on given graph $G=(V,E)$ where $|V|=n$,
we can construct a new graph $G'$ in ploynomial time by the following rule:\\
If $k=\frac{n}{2}$, $G'=G$.\\
If $k<\frac{n}{2}$, we construct $G'=(V',E')$ by adding $n-2k$ vertices 
which are mutually connected to each other and are also connected to all
vertices in $V$.\\
If $k>\frac{n}{2}$, we construct $G'=(V',E')$ by adding $2k-n$ vertices
which are not connected to any other vertices in the new graph.\\\\
We now show that there is a k-clique in $G$ if and only if 
there is a clique of size $\frac{|V'|}{2}$ in the new graph $G'$.\\
If $k=\frac{n}{2}$, trivally true.\\
If $k<\frac{n}{2}$, $|V'|=2n-2k$. If there is a k-clique in $G$,
clearly there is a clique of size $k+n-2k=n-k=\frac{|V'|}{2}$ in $G'$,
and vice versa.\\
If $k>\frac{n}{2}$, $|V'|=2k$. If there is a k-clique in $G$,
clearly there is a clique of size $k$ in the new graph $G'$, and vice versa.\\
So our k-clique probelm can be reduced to a $\frac{n}{2}$-clique problem in ploynomial time.
Since k-clique problem is an NP-Complete problem,
our $\frac{n}{2}$-clique probelm is also NP-Complete.

\section*{Problem 2}
\textbf{Proof of NP}:\\
For any possible solution denoted by $S=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n\}, s_i\in \{0,1\}$ 
where $s_i=1$ denotes picking item $i$ and $s_i=0$ denotes not picking,
simply check whether $\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_iw_i\leq C$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_iv_i\geq V$
at the same time. 
Clearly this verification process can be done in ploynomial time.\\
\textbf{Proof of NP-Completeness}:\\
We prove by showing that the Subset Sum problem is reducible to our problem here.\\
For a set $A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\}$ and a sum $B$,
the Subset Sum problem asks us whether there is a solution $S=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n\}, s_i\in \{0,1\}$
such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_ia_i=B$,
we can reduce it to a decision version of Knapsack problem
by setting the capacity $C$ and total value $V$ to be $C=V=B$
and set the weights $w_i=a_i$ and values $v_i=a_i$ respectively for all $i\in[n]$.\\
Clearly this process can be done in ploynomial time.\\
Also a solution $S$ which satisfies the Subset Sum problem 
clearly also satisfies the reduced Knapsack problem and vice versa.\\


\section*{Problem 3}
\textbf{Proof of NP}:\\
For any possible solution which provides a subgraph $G'$ of $G$ 
and a mapping $f$ from $G'$ to $H$,
we can easily check whether $G'$ and $H$ are isomorphic to each other 
following the mapping $f$ in ploynomial time. \\
\textbf{Proof of NP-Completeness}:\\
We prove by showing that the k-clique probelm can be reduced to our problem.\\
Actually, finding a k-clique of graph $G$ is actually finding a 
subgraph which is also a \textbf{complete graph of size $k$}.
This means that if a graph $G$ has a complete subgraph of size $k$,
this subgraph is also its k-clique and vice versa.\\
Since k-clique problem is an NP-Complete problem,
our subgraph probelm is also NP-Complete.

\section*{Comments}
I assume the difficulties of these problems are in an ascending order,
so for canvas submission of this homework assignment, 
I only chose the problems $1\sim 3$.\\
For these three problems that I submitted,
there are no collaborators and I did not spend too much time on them.\\
But I will spend more time on the rest of the problems(probably).
